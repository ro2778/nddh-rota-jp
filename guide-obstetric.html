<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">This guide owes its existence to the work of Dr Simon Bricker, Consultant Anaesthetist at the Countess of Chester Hospital, who in 2014 produced an outstanding document on obstetric analgesia and anaesthesia for trainees in his department. That guide was a model of clarity, honesty and practical wisdom. It was the kind of document that a nervous trainee would reach for at three in the morning, and that a more experienced anaesthetist might still consult when confronted with the unfamiliar.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">The present guide is adapted from Bricker’s original for use at North Devon District Hospital (NDDH), Barnstaple. Clinical content has been updated to reflect current evidence and national guidelines. Local practices have been incorporated throughout. Where NDDH-specific information was not yet available at the time of writing, this is clearly marked.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">The text has been developed with the assistance of Claude 4.6 Opus, an AI language model created by Anthropic. Any errors are the responsibility of the human author.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Simon Bricker’s guide was an act of generosity towards the trainees who would follow him. This document aspires to continue that tradition.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Introduction</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">This document provides guidance and information about aspects of obstetric analgesia and anaesthesia in the Maternity Unit at North Devon District Hospital (NDDH). Its contents should be seen as guidelines and not as strict protocols which allow no autonomy of practice nor independence of thought and judgement. However, a certain rigidity of approach is inevitable in some recommendations.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">The NDDH Maternity Unit consists of a combined antenatal/postnatal ward (Bassett Ward) and a central delivery suite (CDS), which includes one operating theatre and six delivery rooms, two of which have birthing pools. There are no dedicated recovery or high dependency areas either on CDS or the ward, which does place some constraints on options for anaesthetic and analgesic techniques. High dependency-type monitoring and care can nonetheless be carried out in any of the main delivery rooms until transfer to intensive care or another unit can be arranged.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Anaesthetic Assistance</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">A trained ODA or ODP is available on call at all times for the labour ward. Anaesthetists are urged not to proceed in the absence of trained assistance and this recommendation should be followed except in those circumstances in which the life of mother or baby may immediately be at risk. If there are difficulties in obtaining trained assistance, the on-call consultant should be contacted.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Documentation and Record Keeping</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">It should be a source of professional pride to make thorough and informative records, but at the very least good documentation is an important act of self-preservation. Complaints and litigation are on a steep upward curve and obstetric anaesthesia is a fertile source of both.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Epidural records are generated on EPIC, although you are free to make an additional entry in the notes. For procedures in theatre, use the intra-operative tab on EPIC which also allows you to document regional anaesthesia. Record the level of block during subarachnoid or epidural anaesthesia for caesarean section. Record the sensory modality that you have used. Litigation relating to inadequate regional anaesthesia is the commonest cause of obstetric anaesthetic litigation and incomplete records make these cases almost impossible to contest.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Problem Patients and Critical Incidents</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">A file in the anaesthetic room on CDS contains details about patients who may present potential problems and who have been seen by an obstetric anaesthetist. The file contains details of the problem and an outline of the suggested anaesthetic management. Examples include women who have undergone back surgery; women with disorders of coagulation such as von Willebrand’s disease; women with congenital cardiac disease, and increasingly common, women with raised BMI.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Should you have a significant complication or critical incident (including inadvertent dural puncture), please complete a Datix incident form. Please ensure that one of the obstetric anaesthetic consultants is made aware of all such incidents; not necessarily at the time, but ideally before the patient has left hospital.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">OAA/AAGBI Minimum Standards</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">The Obstetric Anaesthetists’ Association (OAA), together with the Association of Anaesthetists, have published revised recommendations relating to obstetric anaesthetic services (most recently in 2023). Recommendations of immediate relevance are summarised below. They have no strict legal validity but would certainly be cited in any litigation.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Caesarean Section Categories</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">The RCoA audit standards suggest 90% of category 1 sections should be delivered within 30 minutes of the decision, and the DDI for 90% of category 2 sections should be less than 75 minutes. The time from informing the anaesthetist that a mother requests epidural analgesia to attendance should not exceed 30 minutes, and no longer than 1 hour other than in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Guidelines for Informing Senior Medical Staff</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Feel free to contact the on-call consultant whenever there are difficulties or particular concerns. Situations which should prompt a call include:</p>
<ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:20px">
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Complications of regional or general anaesthesia: dural puncture, PDPH, neurological problems, difficult/failed intubation, awareness, pulmonary aspiration.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Major obstetric haemorrhage.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Severe hypertensive disease of pregnancy.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Mothers with significant acute or chronic medical problems.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Obesity: in those in whom difficulty is anticipated, especially if long epidural needles are contemplated. Consider ultrasound for depth and midline.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Placenta praevia.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Conflicts with obstetric staff regarding anaesthetic management.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Obesity</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Following NAP3 (2009), obstetric neuraxial techniques were found to carry less risk than previously believed. The incidence of permanent harm is at worst 1 in 80,000 procedures, possibly as low as 1 in 320,000. With absolute numbers so small, the influence of body habitus is an unknown factor; a mother with a BMI of 45 can be given no more specific risk information than one with a BMI of 30.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Obesity does not alter fundamental anatomical relationships. While it makes bag-valve-mask ventilation more problematic, studies of bariatric patients demonstrate that morbidly obese patients are no more difficult to intubate than those of normal weight. Surgery is invariably more difficult in the obese; anaesthesia is not necessarily so. A very obese mother may still have a back in which the lumbar spines are readily palpable and in whom spinals and epidurals are straightforward.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Mothers with a BMI of 40 or greater are referred for anaesthetic review prior to delivery, and a summary should be found on EPIC together with an alert flag. The duty anaesthetist should make an early assessment of any morbidly obese woman.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Contraindications to Epidural and Subarachnoid Block</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Absolute contraindications include patient refusal and active haemorrhage with hypovolaemia. Congenital cardiac conditions causing shunt reversal (e.g. Eisenmenger complex) with sympathetic block are extremely rare. Local infection at the site is obvious but rare. Systemic sepsis does not necessarily mandate general anaesthesia unless there is significant cardiovascular compromise. Grossly deranged coagulation in severe pre-eclampsia normally precludes neuraxial block. Anatomical abnormality and most neurological disease do not preclude epidural analgesia, provided the situation is discussed with the mother.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Epidural Analgesia</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">The ideal obstetric epidural would block only pain fibres while sparing all other modalities, and would thus cause no motor block. This ideal is probably unattainable, but the aim should be safe and effective analgesia with the minimum of motor weakness. Low-dose local anaesthetic/opioid combinations are standard. The most commonly used nationally is levobupivacaine 0.1% with fentanyl 2 micrograms/ml. At NDDH we use patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) in line with NICE Guidance for Intrapartum Care.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Epidural analgesia is available on request by any mother. This nominally is a 24-hour service, but in practice there are times when a mother may have to use alternative forms of analgesia before an anaesthetist is available.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Consent</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">A mother who may have received opioids, who is using Entonox, and who is distracted by severe pain, is not ideally placed to assimilate detailed risk information. Ensure that information is available antenatally. At the time of the epidural, explain the procedure and its main risks in terms the mother can understand, and satisfy yourself that she has given informed consent.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Establishing an Epidural</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6;font-weight:700">Intravenous access</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Gain IV access. Routine fluid preloading is not necessary with low-dose solutions. If fluid is given, it need only be given once.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6;font-weight:700">Epidural insertion</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Use a 16G or 18G Tuohy needle. Loss-of-resistance to saline (the Doughty method) is the standard technique. Loss-of-resistance to air has been associated with patchy blocks, venous air embolism, and may compound headache with pneumocephalus. Average epidural space depth is 4–5 cm. A useful formula:</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6;font-weight:700">‘Safe depth’ (cm) = body weight (kg) / 25</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">But the reported range spans 2 to more than 10 cm.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6;font-weight:700">Initial dose</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6;font-weight:700">Test dose</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Not strictly necessary with a low-dose regimen. Injection of 15 ml of dilute solution will not cause a total spinal block (though it will provide anaesthesia to about T4).</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6;font-weight:700">Monitoring</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Blood pressure every 5 minutes for 15 minutes after the first dose. Check block adequacy.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6;font-weight:700">PCEA and ongoing analgesia</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">At NDDH, ongoing analgesia is delivered by PCEA pump. Only the anaesthetist boluses manually when siting or troubleshooting — midwives do not manually bolus into the epidural catheter. The mother delivers extra doses via the pump’s button.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Aseptic Technique</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Ensure that antiseptic skin preparation does not contact the equipment used for epidural or spinal block. A separate preparation trolley is recommended.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Ambulation</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">The mother is the best judge of her motor power. If she can support her weight standing with a partially bent knee, she should be able to walk accompanied. The upright position aids labour progress. In practice, most mothers are bed-bound not because of the epidural but because of continuous fetal monitoring.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia (PCEA)</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">PCEA reduces total local anaesthetic dose, improves maternal satisfaction, and reduces the need for anaesthetist-delivered top-ups. It is the standard method of epidural maintenance at NDDH.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Remifentanil PCA</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Remifentanil PCA for labour analgesia requires careful consideration of both efficacy and safety. There are reports of significant maternal oxygen desaturation. If available at NDDH, it should be used with one-to-one midwifery care and continuous pulse oximetry.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Special Circumstances and Combined Spinal-Epidural (CSE)</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">A distressed but cooperative mother may benefit from a CSE technique, which provides rapid analgesia (onset in over 3 minutes in 65% of mothers). Alternatively, 10 ml of lidocaine 2% via the epidural catheter can provide rapid relief.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">CSE procedure:</p>
<ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:20px">
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Employ the usual precautions (venous access) and monitoring.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Locate the epidural space using your preferred method.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Insert a pencil-point long spinal needle through the Tuohy into the subarachnoid space.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Inject intrathecally: 3–4 ml of the low-dose epidural solution, or levobupivacaine 2.5 mg + fentanyl 25 mcg made up with NaCl 0.9%.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Remove the spinal needle and thread the catheter into the epidural space.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Analgesia lasts 60–90 minutes. The spinal needle fails to locate the subarachnoid space in ~10% of cases.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Pruritus is common with the higher fentanyl dose but usually transient. Low-dose naloxone may help without reversing analgesia. Ondansetron also has a useful anti-pruritic action.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Extending Epidural Blocks for Instrumental/Operative Delivery</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Many anaesthetists now have a low threshold for removing the epidural catheter and performing a spinal, and with good reason. The threshold for extending an epidural for theatre should be high: the epidural must have been immaculate during labour. A meta-analysis found that failed conversion was associated with increased bolus doses during labour, increased urgency of delivery, and anaesthetist experience. BMI, duration of epidural, and cervical dilatation at insertion had no influence.</p>
<h4 style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:10px 0 4px;font-weight:700">Top-up for forceps where speed is essential (block required T10–S5)</h4>
<ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:20px">
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Levobupivacaine 0.5% × 10 ml plus lidocaine 2% × 5 ml ± NaHCO₃ 8.4% × 2 ml</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:10px 0 4px;font-weight:700">Top-up for straightforward forceps or ventouse (T10–S5)</h4>
<ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:20px">
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">If analgesia is good: 15 ml of epidural solution.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">If wearing off: levobupivacaine 0.5% × 10 ml plus lidocaine 2% × 5 ml.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4 style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:10px 0 4px;font-weight:700">Top-up for caesarean section — urgent (T4–S5)</h4>
<ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:20px">
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Levobupivacaine 0.5% × 20 ml + NaHCO₃ 8.4% × 2 ml, OR</li>

</ul>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">NaHCO₃ alkalinises the solution, increases the non-ionised fraction and decreases latency by up to 50%. Mix the local anaesthetics before adding NaHCO₃ or the solution will precipitate.</p>
<h4 style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:10px 0 4px;font-weight:700">Epidural of doubtful efficacy</h4>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">If suboptimal, remove the catheter and do a spinal. An inadequate block is almost impossible to retrieve and is a common source of litigation. Symmetrical vasodilatation (two warm feet) is a useful sign of an effective bilateral block.</p>
<h4 style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:10px 0 4px;font-weight:700">Rectal pressure</h4>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Rectal and perineal pressure can break through a working epidural. Options: fentanyl 100 mcg via epidural catheter, or clonidine 75–100 mcg.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">The Inadequate Epidural</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">A significant proportion of epidurals provide suboptimal relief. Catheters can escape through intervertebral foramina and remain unilateral. Some mothers have a dorsomedian fold separating the two sides of the extradural space. Risk factors for inadequacy include multiparity, previous suboptimal epidural, loss of resistance to air, and cervical dilatation greater than 7 cm.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Management: withdraw catheter 1–2 cm; try a standard top-up of levobupivacaine 0.25–0.5%; lying on the unblocked side is not usually helpful (only 1–2 segments difference after 30 minutes). Resiting may be the best option. We must acknowledge that some mothers will not achieve adequate analgesia despite every manoeuvre.</p>

<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Hypotension</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">If BP drops &gt;20%, fetal heart slows, or the mother is faint or nauseated:</p>
<ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:20px">
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Lateral position (exclude aortocaval compression).</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Oxygen via facemask.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg boluses (repeated) and/or ephedrine 6 mg.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Rapid fluid administration.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Pruritus</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Common with spinal opioids. Chlorpheniramine is of limited benefit. Ondansetron is the most practical first-line treatment. Naloxone 0.1–0.4 mg may help but risks reversing analgesia.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Inadvertent Dural Puncture</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Inadvertent dural puncture with a Tuohy needle must be taken seriously. Labour can proceed normally. There is little logic in resiting the epidural in another interspace. Threading the catheter intrathecally for continuous subarachnoid analgesia has several advantages: certainty of catheter position; no risk of further dural breaches; minimises high block likelihood; ensures good analgesia; and may reduce the need for blood patching.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Management</h3>
<ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:20px">
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Pass 2–3 cm of epidural catheter into the subarachnoid space.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Initial intrathecal dose: 3–4 ml of epidural solution (allow for 1 ml dead space in catheter and filter).</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Continue with 2–5 ml as required, given by an anaesthetist.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Mark the catheter clearly as intrathecal.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Inform a consultant obstetric anaesthetist.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Dose may need increasing due to tachyphylaxis.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Post-Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH)</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Dural puncture with a 16G Tuohy causes headache in &gt;80% of mothers (40–50% with an 18G). Classic presentation: postural headache at 24–48 hours, radiating to neck and shoulders, disabling. May be atypical: neck stiffness, pressure behind the eyes, muffled hearing, sixth nerve palsy.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">PDPH is due to traction on intracranial pain-sensitive structures unsupported by CSF, and compensatory vasodilatation. If systemic symptoms supervene (nausea, anorexia, lethargy, profound malaise), this indicates sagging of intracranial contents onto the brain stem. Neglected PDPH has been associated with fatal subdural haemorrhage.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Management</h3>
<ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:20px">
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Hydration: does not influence CSF production. Makes the mother feel better but does not fix the headache.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Position: supine/prone attenuates symptoms. Keeping flat preventatively is ineffectual and increases thromboembolism risk.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Simple analgesics: modest symptomatic relief only.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Caffeine 300 mg PO: reduces headache severity in ~90% within 4 hours, but does not reduce the need for blood patching.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Epidural blood patch (EBP): abolishes symptoms in 60–75%. Target volume: 20 ml of autologous blood. Inject at or below the level of the puncture. Stop if the mother reports nuchal, shoulder, or buttock pain. Ideally done or supervised by a consultant.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Management of a High Block</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Characterised by upper limb weakness and paraesthesia, cardiovascular changes, respiratory embarrassment, weak voice and cough, sensory loss over neck and jaw. Profound bradycardia is rare despite textbook assertions. These blocks are very frightening for the mother but characteristically regress quickly.</p>
<ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:20px">
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Maintain left lateral tilt. Keep shoulders higher than thoracic spine.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Oxygen via facemask. Intubate if necessary.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg boluses and/or ephedrine 6 mg. Rapid fluid.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Consider midazolam 1 mg increments for anxiety.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Inform a senior colleague. Reassure mother and relatives.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">At least one documented post-delivery visit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Management of a Total Spinal</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Unlikely with low-dose solutions given intrathecally. May follow a concentrated epidural top-up for caesarean section. Clinical picture may include hypotension, apnoea and unconsciousness, but haemodynamic changes are not always dramatic. This situation is retrievable.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Subdural Block</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">An epidural catheter may enter the subdural space. Features: patchy block, often extensive and unilateral, may extend very high (the subdural space extends into the cranium), usually spares sacral roots, minimal sympathetic block, delayed onset. With successive top-ups the arachnoid may tear, delivering the entire dose intrathecally. If an atypical block raises suspicion, remove the catheter and resite.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Local Anaesthetic Toxicity</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Inadvertent intravenous administration of local anaesthetic is always a potential complication, particularly when extending an epidural for operative delivery. Should a large bolus be injected, the familiar prodromal symptoms may be absent as the mother convulses or has circulatory collapse. Intravenous lipid emulsion (Intralipid 20%) improves outcome.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Management of Suspected LA Toxicity</h3>
<ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:20px">
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Airway, Breathing, Circulation — standard resuscitation.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">From 500 ml of Intralipid 20%, infuse: 1.5 ml/kg stat bolus.</li>

<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Regional Techniques and Thrombocytopenia</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Platelet function matters as much as numbers. Most UK anaesthetists are comfortable above 100 × 10⁹/L and wary below 50 × 10⁹/L. Between 50–100, distinguish between an epidural (higher risk of traumatising epidural veins) and a spinal with a fine pencil-point needle. Point-of-care coagulation testing (ROTEM/TEG) may help where available. If in doubt, seek senior advice.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Heparins and Aspirin</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">An epidural should not be attempted, nor an epidural catheter removed, until at least 12 hours after prophylactic-dose LMWH. For treatment-dose LMWH, the interval should be at least 24 hours. Most UK anaesthetists do not see low-dose aspirin (75 mg daily) as a contraindication. Always consult the latest OAA/AAGBI guidance as recommendations evolve.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Neuraxial Techniques in the Pyrexial Mother</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Pyrexia is common in labouring mothers although the incidence of bacteraemia is relatively low (3–7%). Multiple studies are reassuring: no increased incidence of meningitis or neurological sequelae in bacteraemic patients or those with chorioamnionitis who had neuraxial blocks. Ensure appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis or treatment has been given before proceeding.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Epidural Analgesia — A Final Perspective</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Anaesthetists have made the technique of epidural analgesia their own, and the possession of this skill is responsible almost undoubtedly for more unanticipated late-night calls than any other branch of anaesthesia. But martyrs as we are, our inclination is to try to provide the service at all costs.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Consider this thought experiment. You are suffering from an intermittent but severe pain. An anaesthetist tells you that the pain may get worse but guarantees that within six hours it will completely and finally disappear. The alternative is an injection in the back, which has a 70% likelihood of good pain relief, but at least a 15% chance of being suboptimal. This procedure is generally safe, but some people have suffered a range of side effects. A number have suffered permanent nerve damage, and some have died. The injection is made through an instrument whose dimensions approximate a three-inch nail. Which option would you choose?</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">The pain of labour is unique. It is the only severe pain in human experience (apart perhaps from dysmenorrhoea) which is not associated with trauma or disease. It may be of the utmost intensity but it is productive and, above all, it is finite.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Bear these thoughts in mind when you are next standing at 3.30 a.m. looking at the expansive back of a 130 kilogram mother who is on subcutaneous heparin.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Anaesthesia for Operative Delivery</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">The vast majority of elective caesarean sections are performed under spinal. In experienced hands there is usually time for a spinal in most emergencies. Attempt spinal anaesthesia as long as you do not persist beyond a time agreed with the obstetrician. Inexperience of the obstetrician is not an indication for general anaesthesia.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Subarachnoid Block: Fluids and Vasopressors</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Routine crystalloid preloading has limited efficacy. Maintain blood pressure with a phenylephrine infusion (50 mcg/ml). Starting rate of 50 mcg/min is usually sufficient. For additional boluses, phenylephrine 100–150 mcg. If refractory, metaraminol 1 mg. Note: alpha₁-agonists commonly decrease cardiac output even as they increase MAP. A fall in maternal heart rate below baseline is a surrogate marker of falling cardiac output, at which point ephedrine is a more logical choice.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Spinal Needle</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Always use atraumatic (pencil-point) needles. Quincke (cutting) tip needles must never be used in obstetrics due to unacceptable PDPH rates. Once CSF appears, advance another millimetre. Replacing the stylet before withdrawal reduces PDPH rate.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Drugs for Subarachnoid Anaesthesia</h3>
<ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:20px">
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Heavy bupivacaine 0.5%: 2.5–3.0 ml gives reliable anaesthesia to T4–T6. A low block is mostly impossible to retrieve, and unplanned conversion to GA is frequently accompanied by a formal complaint.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Fentanyl 15–25 mcg: improves quality and modestly increases duration. Be prepared for nausea and pruritus.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Diamorphine 0.3 mg (300 mcg): nationally the agent of choice for post-caesarean analgesia. Provides excellent prolonged analgesia (12–24 hours).</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Clonidine (e.g. 0.5 mcg/kg): may double the duration of sensory block but can cause hypotension and sedation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Assessment of Block Height</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Use light touch to assess the block. Loss of light touch to the T5 dermatome should prove adequate. A bilateral block to T4 is sometimes cited as essential, but wide clinical experience confirms T6 is usually entirely adequate. Avoid testing repeatedly or too early — this will not change your management but will worry the mother.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Caesarean Section under Suboptimal Regional Anaesthesia</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Litigation about pain during regional caesarean section is now more common than awareness claims under GA. The patient must be believed. Record the exact nature of symptoms, treatment offered, the mother’s response, treatment given, and its efficacy. Options include IV opioid, nitrous oxide, wound infiltration, epidural top-up with adjuvants (fentanyl 50–100 mcg and/or clonidine up to 150 mcg), or general anaesthesia. Involve the mother in the decision. Document clearly.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Spinals in Women with Inadequate Epidurals</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Feel the feet before extending an epidural: one cool foot means a partly one-sided block that will be exposed at surgery. If suboptimal, remove the catheter and do a spinal. Use not less than 2.5 ml heavy bupivacaine 0.5%. Position with cervical spine higher than lumbar. The concern about high blocks has been exaggerated, particularly when time has elapsed since the last top-up.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">The Inadequate Spinal</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Failure rate approximately 1%. Options: general anaesthesia (safest and most defensible); resite epidural; cautiously repeat the spinal. If repeating, assess residual block, give a proportion of the original dose, and elevate the cervical spine above the thoracic kyphosis.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Acute Uterine Relaxation</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Options when the obstetrician requests urgent uterine relaxation:</p>
<ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:20px">
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Halogenated volatiles: at least 2 MAC. Sevoflurane is more effective than isoflurane.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">GTN: 100 mcg IV or sublingual spray 1–2 puffs (400–800 mcg).</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Terbutaline: 0.25 mg IV.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">MgSO₄: 4 g IV.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Anticipate increased blood loss from the atonic uterus.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Supplemental Oxygen</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Supplemental O₂ during elective caesarean section under regional anaesthesia is not necessary in healthy parturients. For emergency cases, it remains reasonable to offer it. Some mothers find facemasks claustrophobic.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Placenta Praevia</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Most cases can be managed under spinal with appropriate precautions: wide-bore IV access, vasopressors drawn up, blood immediately available. An anterior praevia with a previous caesarean scar carries high risk of placenta accreta. Seek senior advice if in doubt.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Cell Salvage</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Well-established in obstetrics. Use for cases likely to involve significant blood loss. In Rh-negative mothers with Rh D-positive (or unknown) babies: give at least 1500 IU anti-D after reinfusion and send a Kleihauer test at 30–45 minutes.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">General Anaesthesia</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Regional block is safer than GA. There should be a definite indication for GA: most commonly acute fetal compromise (emergency) or maternal preference (elective). Use an overpressure technique for volatile agents to ensure rapid rise in brain concentrations and prevent awareness (e.g. sevoflurane 3% for 5 minutes, reducing to 2%, then 1–1.5% after delivery). Aortocaval compression may persist even with 30° tilt; use leftward manual displacement of the uterus if needed.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Cricoid Pressure</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">10 N awake, 30 N after loss of consciousness (approximately 3 kg). Assistants can practise on weighing scales. Fails to occlude the oesophagus in ~50% of cases due to inaccurate application. Release if it impedes intubation. If the mother is actively vomiting, release immediately — the risk of oesophageal rupture exceeds that of pulmonary aspiration.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Feeding in Labour</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Free fluids and a light low-fat diet for mothers without risk factors who have not received systemic opioids (NICE recommendation). Gastric volumes and acidity increase with prolonged fasting. Most mothers in advanced labour stick to fluids.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Acid Aspiration Prophylaxis</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Labouring women at higher risk of operative delivery: ranitidine 150 mg PO 6-hourly. Elective CS: nil solids 6 hours, clear fluids 2 hours, ranitidine 150 mg PO 2 hours pre-op, sodium citrate 0.3M 30 ml pre-induction. Emergency CS: ranitidine 50 mg IV if &gt;5 hours since last dose, plus sodium citrate.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Prophylactic Antibiotics</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">The evidence is overwhelming: antibiotics should be administered before skin incision, not at cord clamping.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Oxytocin</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">5 IU diluted in 100 ml NaCl 0.9%, infused slowly over 5–10 minutes after delivery. The minimum effective dose for uncomplicated elective CS is very low (ED90 approximately 0.35 IU). Patients who have received oxytocin during labour require higher doses due to receptor desensitisation. Oxytocin has an antidiuretic action and causes a fall in SVR with compensatory tachycardia.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Post-operative Analgesia</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Most mothers are mobile and caring for their babies within 24 hours. Enhanced recovery approach: early oral intake, early removal of IV and catheter, early mobilisation, regular oral analgesia. Avoid NSAIDs in pre-eclamptic mothers (risk of renal failure).</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Failed Intubation</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Failed intubation is more commonly reported in obstetric practice (~1 in 250 GAs) than non-obstetric (~1 in 2230). Contributing factors include soft tissue oedema, haste, misplaced cricoid pressure, and the atmosphere of tension. Studies show that many mothers who could not be intubated when pregnant were intubated successfully on another occasion, suggesting early abandonment of attempts.</p>

<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">If two or more risk factors are present, serious consideration should be given to avoiding general anaesthesia.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Difficult Intubation: Key Principles</h3>
<ul style="margin:4px 0;padding-left:20px">
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Do not attempt to turn the mother into a full lateral position during the drill.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Use airway adjuncts gently. Gum elastic bougies can perforate the piriform fossa.</li>
<li style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:3px 0;line-height:1.5">Do not give a second dose of suxamethonium. It will not improve intubating conditions and unpredictable autonomic effects superimposed upon desaturation may be calamitous.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">You should be familiar with the DAS/OAA guidelines for management of failed tracheal intubation in obstetrics (2015, updated 2023). The algorithm should be displayed in the maternity theatre. Key elements: maintain oxygenation, use supraglottic airway devices, and consider waking the mother if there is no surgical urgency.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Hypertensive Disease of Pregnancy</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">The choice of anaesthetic technique for caesarean section in pre-eclampsia is much less controversial than once it was. The traditional dogma that only incremental epidural anaesthesia should be used is not supported by evidence. Several studies confirm that spinal anaesthesia is safe in pre-eclampsia, and clinical experience suggests that mothers with pre-existing hypertension are often the group in whom blood pressure remains the most stable.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">The Pressor Response to Intubation</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Hypertensive mothers can demonstrate huge surges in arterial blood pressure in response to laryngoscopy and intubation. A wide range of drugs have been used to obtund the pressor response. A reasonable approach is alfentanil 7.5 mcg/kg prior to induction, combined with MgSO₄ 30 mg/kg. Be aware that alfentanil may cause severe compromise in preterm or sick babies.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Fluids and Vasopressors in Pre-eclampsia</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Fluid loading should be modest (up to 10 ml/kg). Colloid (e.g. Gelofusine or Human Albumin Solution 4.5%) may be appropriate prior to delivery. Post-delivery: restrict to approximately 85 ml/hr. Hypertensive mothers are more sensitive to vasopressors: start at 25–50% of normal dose and titrate against response.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Anaesthesia Post-partum</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Gastric emptying is normal approximately one day after delivery. A pragmatic approach: rapid sequence technique within 12–24 hours of delivery, clinical judgement thereafter. Use regional anaesthesia wherever possible.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Manual Removal of Retained Placenta</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Retained placenta occurs in about 2.5% of deliveries. Manual removal is required if the placenta has not delivered within 30 minutes. The procedure is urgent. Subarachnoid anaesthesia with heavy bupivacaine 0.5% × 2.0 ml usually provides reliable anaesthesia. If an epidural is in place, it can be topped up. The procedure is routinely performed in theatre.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Perineal Repair</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">A spinal saddle block is very effective. Perform a spinal in the sitting position, inject approximately 1.5 ml heavy bupivacaine 0.5% slowly, and keep the mother sitting for 5–10 minutes to densely anaesthetise the sacral roots while minimising rostral spread.</p>
<h3 style="font-size:13px;color:#2C3E50;margin:14px 0 6px;font-weight:700">Mendelson’s Syndrome</h3>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">What we now call Mendelson’s Syndrome is not the self-limiting chemical pneumonitis that Mendelson described in 1946, but a severe form of ARDS with high mortality, produced when positive pressure ventilation disperses acidic aerosol throughout the bronchial tree. The practical point: if you suspect aspiration after intubation, suction through the tracheal tube as thoroughly as possible before ventilating. The few seconds of relative hypoxia may reduce the likelihood of catastrophic lung injury.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:15px;color:#1A5276;margin:20px 0 8px;font-weight:700">Major Obstetric Haemorrhage</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Maternal haemorrhage may be acute, dramatic, massive and catastrophic. It may also be gradual, undramatic, massive and catastrophic. The blood supply to the uterus at term can reach 600–800 ml/min. The slow loss of blood volume over hours post-partum is arguably more dangerous because patients compensate until near-irreversible collapse.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Systolic blood pressure is a crude index which may show little change until 30–40% of blood volume has been lost. The pulse pressure may give earlier warning: it narrows as blood loss continues and MAP may actually increase. Close monitoring of trends is vital.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;color:#2C3E50;margin:6px 0;line-height:1.6">Target fibrinogen in obstetric haemorrhage: &gt;2 g/L (higher than the 1.5 g/L non-obstetric target).</p>
